            My name is Kyle Frudakis and I am entering the latter half of my studies. I am currently majoring
            in Computer Science but have found a lot of other interests along the way. Outside of academics, I have plenty of hobbies.
            One of them is soccer. I have played soccer for a majority of my life and still do to this day. I dream of mine is
            to be able to play at a higher level some day. Dreams don't stop unless you do! Other than soccer, I have picked up
            a knack for fishing. I haven't caught anything spectacular yet but I hope in the future I'll get better at it. The best 
            I've caught so far are some catfish and a crab by accident. In my free time, I like to create programs that help me 
            on a day to day basis. In terms of programming, I am pretty confident using python, c++, HTML&CSS, although I prefer python.
            I have some experience working with Django and the Pygames module. I enjoy problem solving just as long as it doesnt keep
            me up too late.
